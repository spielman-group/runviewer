"""Stand-ins shared by runviewer's tests.

``runviewer/__main__.py`` builds a ``Splash`` and calls ``show()`` on it at
module scope, and the ``splash.hide()`` that would take it down again runs only
under ``if __name__ == '__main__'``. So a test that imports the module puts the
startup banner on the screen of whoever ran the suite and leaves it there, for
the life of the process.

Stubbing ``labscript_utils.splash`` before that import fixes it at the source
rather than papering over it: with the stub in place no ``QApplication`` is
created at all, so there is no window to leak. Hiding the splash afterwards
would not do as well, because the application would still have been built and
the banner would still have flickered up.

The stub only works if it is installed *before* ``runviewer.__main__`` is
imported, which is an ordering constraint no test file should have to carry --
a reordered import block would quietly bring the banner back. So this module
owns both the stub and the import, and re-exports what the suite borrows from
the application. Tests import those names from here and never from
``runviewer.__main__`` directly, which is the arrangement runmanager and BLACS
use in their own ``fixtures.py``.

Borrowing from ``__main__`` at all is the last resort. A test reaches for a leaf
module first, as lyse's tests do with ``lyse.widgets`` and BLACS's with
``blacs.front_panel_settings``, and failing that loads the module by path with
its dependencies stubbed, as ``blacs/tests/test_plugins_compat.py`` does.
Neither is open to a method of ``RunViewer``: there is no leaf module holding
it, and loading ``__main__`` by path would mean stubbing every one of its
imports to reach a single handler.

Tests that need a ``QApplication`` build their own. Nothing here creates one,
and nothing here shows a widget.
